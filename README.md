SocioGram is a platform for finding and building local communities.
It's mission is to help people grow and achieve their goals through real-life, human connections. From professional networking to craft brewery crawls to coding workshops, people use SocioGram to meet new people, get out of their comfort zones, learn new things, pursue passions, and find supportive communities that will help them thrive.

SocioGram simplifies the process of helping you find people based on your available times, your location, you favorite sports, and your skill level.

Organizers use this website to create groups and host events. Members can search for groups based on what interests them, request to become a member, and join the group to attend upcoming events. The organizers and members show up for the event, connect in real life and grow their community over time through regularly scheduled events.
